# dawcore Package (`@dawcore/components`)

**Purpose:** Framework-agnostic Web Components for multi-track audio editing. Wraps `PlaylistEngine` + `createToneAdapter()` in Lit elements so any framework (or vanilla HTML) can render waveforms and control playback.

**Architecture:** Data elements (`<daw-track>`, `<daw-clip>`) use light DOM; visual elements (`<daw-waveform>`, `<daw-playhead>`, `<daw-ruler>`) use Shadow DOM with chunked canvas rendering. `<daw-editor>` orchestrates everything. Transport elements find their target via `for` attribute.

**Build:** Uses tsup — `pnpm typecheck && tsup`. Outputs ESM + CJS + DTS. `sideEffects: true` because element imports register custom elements globally.

**Testing:** vitest with happy-dom in `src/__tests__/`. Run with `cd packages/dawcore && npx vitest run`.

**Dev page:** `pnpm dev:page` starts Vite at `http://localhost:5173/dev/index.html`. Uses `website/static/` as publicDir for audio files.

## Element Types

**Data elements (light DOM):**
- `<daw-clip>` — Declarative clip data (src, start, duration, offset, gain, fades). Auto-generated `clipId`.
- `<daw-track>` — Track data (name, volume, pan, muted, soloed). Dispatches `daw-track-connected` on mount, `daw-track-update` on property change. Track removal detected by editor's MutationObserver (not events — detached elements can't bubble).

**Visual elements (Shadow DOM):**
- `<daw-waveform>` — Chunked canvas rendering (1000px chunks). Receives peaks as JS properties.
- `<daw-playhead>` — RAF-animated vertical line via `AnimationController`.
- `<daw-ruler>` — Temporal time scale with tick marks. Ported from `SmartScale` (temporal mode only, beats & bars deferred). Computes ticks once in `willUpdate()`, reused by both `render()` and `updated()`.

**Control elements:**
- `<daw-editor>` — Core orchestrator. Builds engine eagerly, loads audio per-track on `daw-track-connected`, renders waveforms from decoded peaks.
- `<daw-transport for="editor-id">` — Container that resolves target via `document.getElementById`. Light DOM.
- `<daw-play-button>`, `<daw-pause-button>`, `<daw-stop-button>` — Walk up to closest `<daw-transport>` for target resolution. Warn when target is null.

## Key Patterns

- **Event-driven track loading** — `<daw-track>` dispatches `daw-track-connected` (bubbling, composed); `<daw-editor>` listens and loads audio for that track individually. Track removal uses MutationObserver (events from `disconnectedCallback` can't bubble since element is already detached).
- **Eager audio decode** — Audio fetches and decodes on track connect using `OfflineAudioContext` (no user gesture required, unlike `AudioContext`). Waveforms render immediately without waiting for play.
- **Engine built lazily on first track load** — `PlaylistEngine` + adapter created when the first `_loadTrack` resolves (uses correct `sampleRate` from decoded audio). `engine.setTracks()` called as tracks load (builds playout structure). `engine.init()` deferred to first `play()` (resumes AudioContext, requires user gesture).
- **Engine API note** — `adapter.addTrack()` throws if no playout exists, so the editor always uses `setTracks()` with all tracks. `addTrack()` is not used in Phase 1.
- **Immutable state updates** — All `@state()` Maps are replaced with `new Map(old).set(...)`, never mutated in place.
- **Derived width, not stored state** — `_totalWidth` is a getter derived from `_duration`, `_sampleRate`, and `samplesPerPixel`. Not a `@state()` property — avoids Lit update loops from setting state in `updated()`.
- **Error events** — `daw-track-error` dispatched on load failure (with `{ trackId, error }`). `daw-error` dispatched on playback failure (with `{ operation, error }`). Failed fetch promises are removed from cache to allow retry.
- **Engine promise retry** — `_enginePromise` is cleared on rejection so `_ensureEngine()` can retry instead of caching a permanent failure.
- **Multi-channel peak aggregation** — `_generatePeaks()` aggregates across all channels (min-of-mins, max-of-maxes). When `mono` is true, only channel 0 is used.

## CSS Theming

Custom properties on `<daw-editor>` or any ancestor, inherited through Shadow DOM:

- `--daw-wave-color` (default: `#c49a6c`)
- `--daw-playhead-color` (default: `#d08070`)
- `--daw-background` (default: `#1a1a2e`)
- `--daw-track-background` (default: `#16213e`)
- `--daw-ruler-color` / `--daw-ruler-background`
- `--daw-controls-background` / `--daw-controls-text`
- `--daw-selection-color`, `--daw-clip-header-background`, `--daw-clip-header-text`

## Reactive Controllers

- `AnimationController` — Start/stop RAF loops, auto-cleanup on `hostDisconnected`. Used by `<daw-playhead>`.
- `ViewportController` — (Scaffolded, not yet wired) Scroll-aware visible range with overscan buffer (1.5x). Will be integrated when `<daw-editor>` supports virtual scrolling.
- `EngineController` — (Scaffolded, not yet wired) DOM traversal to find closest `<daw-editor>`. Will be used by sub-elements that need engine access.

## Ported Utilities

- `peak-rendering.ts` — `aggregatePeaks`, `calculateBarRects`, `calculateFirstBarPosition` (from `ui-components`)
- `smart-scale.ts` — `getScaleInfo`, `computeTemporalTicks` (extracted from `SmartScale.tsx`, temporal mode only)
- `time-format.ts` — `formatTime` for ruler labels

## Interaction Patterns

- **Seek during playback requires stop+play** — Tone.js `transport.seconds = time` doesn't reschedule audio sources. Must call `engine.stop()` then `engine.play(newTime)` and restart playhead animation.
- **Stop returns to play start position** — Standard DAW behavior. Engine tracks `_playStartPosition`; read `engine.getCurrentTime()` in the `stop` event handler, not `_currentTime`.
- **Pointer events, not click** — Use `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup` with 3px activation threshold to distinguish click (seek) from drag (selection). Wrap `releasePointerCapture` in try-catch; use `finally` to reset `_isDragging`.
- **Host scroll for pixel calculations** — `:host` has `overflow-x: auto`, so use `this.scrollLeft` for pointer-to-pixel conversion, not `timeline.scrollLeft` (always 0).
- **Track hit detection via Y position** — `composedPath()[0].closest('.track-row')` can't cross Shadow DOM boundaries. Use `getBoundingClientRect()` on track rows and compare `e.clientY` instead.
- **File type detection** — `file.type` can be empty string for valid audio (`.opus` on some browsers). Only reject files with explicitly non-audio MIME types: `if (file.type && !file.type.startsWith('audio/'))`.
- **`loadFiles()` returns result** — Returns `{ loaded: string[], failed: Array<{ file, error }> }` so callers can detect partial failures. Individual file errors are caught and reported via `daw-files-load-error` events.

## Lit/TypeScript Requirements

- `experimentalDecorators: true` and `useDefineForClassFields: false` in tsconfig — required for Lit's `@property` and `@customElement` decorators
- Light DOM elements override `createRenderRoot()` to return `this`
- `<daw-track>` defers `daw-track-connected` dispatch via `setTimeout(, 0)` so the editor's `connectedCallback` (which registers listeners) has time to run
