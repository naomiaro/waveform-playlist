# dawcore Package (`@dawcore/components`)

**Purpose:** Framework-agnostic Web Components for multi-track audio editing. Wraps `PlaylistEngine` + `createToneAdapter()` in Lit elements so any framework (or vanilla HTML) can render waveforms and control playback.

**Architecture:** Data elements (`<daw-track>`, `<daw-clip>`) use light DOM; visual elements (`<daw-waveform>`, `<daw-playhead>`, `<daw-ruler>`) use Shadow DOM with chunked canvas rendering. `<daw-editor>` orchestrates everything. Transport elements find their target via `for` attribute.

**Build:** Uses tsup — `pnpm typecheck && tsup`. Outputs ESM + CJS + DTS. `sideEffects: true` because element imports register custom elements globally.

**Testing:** vitest with happy-dom in `src/__tests__/`. Run with `cd packages/dawcore && npx vitest run`.

**Testing gotchas:**
- `isConnected` is a readonly getter in happy-dom — cannot be set via `Object.assign` on elements. Append the element to `document.body` instead.
- Mocks for async functions (e.g., `resumeGlobalAudioContext`) must return `Promise.resolve()`, not `undefined`. Calling `.catch()` on `undefined` crashes.
- `canvas.getContext('2d')` returns `null` in happy-dom. Tests must mock it: `vi.spyOn(canvas, 'getContext').mockReturnValue(mockCtx as any)` where `mockCtx` has `clearRect`, `resetTransform`, `scale`, `fillStyle`, `fillRect` as `vi.fn()`.

**Dev page:** `pnpm dev:page` starts Vite at `http://localhost:5173/dev/index.html`. Uses `website/static/` as publicDir for audio files.

## Dev Page Dependencies

- **`pnpm dev:page` resolves peer packages from source** — `dev/vite.config.ts` has `resolve.alias` for core, engine, and playout pointing to `src/index.ts`. Changes are picked up immediately without rebuilding.
- **Incremental track removal** — `engine.removeTrack(trackId)` uses `adapter.removeTrack()` when available (disposes single track, preserves playback). Falls back to `adapter.setTracks()` (full rebuild, stops Transport).

## Element Types

**Data elements (light DOM):**
- `<daw-clip>` — Declarative clip data (src, start, duration, offset, gain, fades). Auto-generated `clipId`.
- `<daw-track>` — Track data (name, volume, pan, muted, soloed). Dispatches `daw-track-connected` on mount, `daw-track-update` on property change. Track removal detected by editor's MutationObserver (not events — detached elements can't bubble).

**Visual elements (Shadow DOM):**
- `<daw-waveform>` — Chunked canvas rendering (1000px chunks). Receives peaks as JS properties. Uses dirty pixel tracking for incremental rendering — `updatePeaks(startIndex, endIndex)` marks a range dirty without full redraw. Bits derived from typed array (Int8Array→8, Int16Array→16). Drawing batched via `requestAnimationFrame`.
- `<daw-playhead>` — RAF-animated vertical line via `AnimationController`.
- `<daw-ruler>` — Temporal time scale with tick marks. Ported from `SmartScale` (temporal mode only, beats & bars deferred). Computes ticks once in `willUpdate()`, reused by both `render()` and `updated()`.

**Control elements:**
- `<daw-editor>` — Core orchestrator. Builds engine lazily on first track load, loads audio per-track on `daw-track-connected`, renders waveforms from decoded peaks.
- `<daw-transport for="editor-id">` — Container that resolves target via `document.getElementById`. Light DOM.
- `<daw-play-button>`, `<daw-pause-button>`, `<daw-stop-button>` — Walk up to closest `<daw-transport>` for target resolution. Warn when target is null.
- `<daw-record-button>` — Transport button. Toggles `startRecording()`/`stopRecording()` on target editor. Listens for `daw-recording-start`/`daw-recording-complete` events to update visual state.

## Recording

- **`RecordingController`** — Lit reactive controller on `<daw-editor>`. Manages AudioWorklet lifecycle, per-channel sample accumulation, incremental peak generation via `appendPeaks()` from `@waveform-playlist/recording`, and live preview via `setPeaksQuiet()` + `updatePeaks()` on `<daw-waveform>`.
- **Session map** — `Map<string, RecordingSession>` keyed by track ID. Single session for now; map structure supports future multi-mic.
- **Consumer provides stream** — `editor.recordingStream = stream` or pass to `startRecording(stream)`. Mic access/permission is consumer responsibility.
- **Cancelable clip creation** — `daw-recording-complete` event is cancelable. `preventDefault()` skips automatic clip creation; consumer handles the `AudioBuffer` themselves.
- **Channel detection** — `stream.getAudioTracks()[0].getSettings().channelCount`, not `source.channelCount` (defaults to 2 per spec).
- **Worklet loading** — `rawContext.audioWorklet.addModule(recordingProcessorUrl)` (native API, not Tone.js which caches single module).
- **Use `getGlobalContext()` not `getGlobalAudioContext()`** — Recording audio graph (source, worklet node) must use Tone.js Context methods (`context.createMediaStreamSource()`, `context.createAudioWorkletNode()`). `getGlobalAudioContext()` returns a `standardized-audio-context` wrapper that fails `instanceof BaseAudioContext` in native constructors. Use `rawContext` only for `audioWorklet.addModule()` and `sampleRate`.
- **Worklet requires `start` command** — `recording-processor` defaults `isRecording=false`. Must `port.postMessage({ command: 'start', channelCount })` after connecting source→worklet. Without it, no data flows. Do NOT send `sampleRate` — the worklet uses its global `sampleRate`.
- **Handler ordering critical** — Set `workletNode.port.onmessage` BEFORE `source.connect(workletNode)` and `postMessage({ command: 'start' })`. The worklet can flush data immediately; messages before handler is wired are silently dropped.
- **Use `createClip()` not `createClipFromSeconds()` for recorded clips** — Recording session provides exact integer samples. The seconds round-trip (`samples/rateA → seconds → Math.round(seconds*rateB)`) drifts when `effectiveSampleRate` differs from `audioBuffer.sampleRate`.
- **`RecordingHost` must declare all host dependencies** — Any property or method the controller accesses on the host must be on the `RecordingHost` interface. No `as any` casts — the editor satisfies the interface directly. `_addRecordedClip?` is optional (runtime check), `shadowRoot` comes from `HTMLElement` intersection.
- **Always clean up partial sessions on error** — `startRecording` adds the session to `_sessions` before connect/start. The catch block must call `_cleanupSession(trackId)` to prevent stuck `isRecording` state and mic leak.
- **Slice latency from AudioBuffer, don't use offsetSamples** — `addRecordedClip` slices the buffer at `offsetSamples` before storing and generating peaks. The clip gets `offsetSamples: 0` since the offset is already applied. This ensures peaks match `durationSamples` exactly — using `offsetSamples` on the clip causes the peak pipeline to generate peaks for the full buffer, making the waveform wider than the clip container.
- **Track height must include recording session channels** — `numChannels` for track height is derived from finalized clip peaks. During live recording with no clips yet, it falls back to 1. Check `_recordingController.getSession(trackId)?.channelCount` for the correct channel count during recording.
- **Live preview position must match finalized clip** — Preview skips latency peaks (slice `latencyPixels * 2` from front) but keeps `left = startSample / spp` (no latency pixel offset on position). Both preview and finalized clip sit at `startSample` — the audio data is what shifts, not the container position.
- **Worklet pause/resume** — `recording-processor` accepts `pause` (flushes partial buffer, stops accumulating) and `resume` (restarts). Controller exposes `pauseRecording()`/`resumeRecording()`, editor delegates. Pause button sends both worklet pause and Transport pause.
- **Peak generation must pass clip offset/duration** — `generatePeaks(buf, spp, mono, offsetSamples, durationSamples)` extracts peaks for only the clip's visible portion. Without offset/duration, clips sharing an AudioBuffer get full-buffer peaks and overlap visually.
- **`clip-headers` boolean attribute** — Defaults to false (no headers). Enable with `<daw-editor clip-headers>`. CSS in `clipStyles` from `theme.ts`. Header height (20px) subtracted from waveform area, divided equally among channels.
- **PeakPipeline baseScale** — Worker generates WaveformData at `baseScale` (default 128, matching AudioWorklet quantum). `extractPeaks` resamples to any coarser zoom level from cache. All zoom levels >= baseScale work without regeneration. Configurable: `new PeakPipeline(baseScale, bits)`.

## Key Patterns

- **Event-driven track loading** — `<daw-track>` dispatches `daw-track-connected` (bubbling, composed); `<daw-editor>` listens and loads audio for that track individually. Track removal uses MutationObserver (events from `disconnectedCallback` can't bubble since element is already detached).
- **Eager audio decode** — Audio fetches and decodes on track connect using `getGlobalAudioContext()` from playout (works while suspended, pre-gesture). Waveforms render immediately without waiting for play.
- **Engine built lazily on first track load** — `PlaylistEngine` + adapter created when the first `_loadTrack` resolves (uses correct `sampleRate` from decoded audio). `engine.setTracks()` called as tracks load (builds playout structure). `engine.init()` deferred to first `play()` (resumes AudioContext, requires user gesture).
- **Engine API note** — Initial track loading uses `engine.setTracks()`. Recording clip finalization uses `engine.updateTrack()` for incremental updates. `adapter.addTrack()` throws if no playout exists.
- **Immutable state updates** — All `@state()` Maps are replaced with `new Map(old).set(...)`, never mutated in place.
- **Derived width, not stored state** — `_totalWidth` is a getter derived from `_duration`, `effectiveSampleRate`, and `samplesPerPixel`. Not a `@state()` property — avoids Lit update loops from setting state in `updated()`.
- **Error events** — `daw-track-error` dispatched on load failure (with `{ trackId, error }`). `daw-error` dispatched on playback failure (with `{ operation, error }`). Failed fetch promises are removed from cache to allow retry.
- **Engine promise retry** — `_enginePromise` is cleared on rejection so `_ensureEngine()` can retry instead of caching a permanent failure.
- **Web worker peak generation** — `PeakPipeline` (in `workers/peakPipeline.ts`) generates `WaveformData` via inline Blob worker at the current `samplesPerPixel`, caches per `AudioBuffer` (WeakMap), extracts `PeakData` via `resample()`. Resampling only works to coarser (larger) scales — the cached base scale determines the finest renderable zoom. Per-channel peaks when `mono=false`; weighted-average mono merge when `mono=true`.

## CSS Theming

Custom properties on `<daw-editor>` or any ancestor, inherited through Shadow DOM:

- `--daw-wave-color` (default: `#c49a6c`)
- `--daw-playhead-color` (default: `#d08070`)
- `--daw-background` (default: `#1a1a2e`)
- `--daw-track-background` (default: `#16213e`)
- `--daw-ruler-color` / `--daw-ruler-background`
- `--daw-controls-background` / `--daw-controls-text`
- `--daw-selection-color`, `--daw-clip-header-background`, `--daw-clip-header-text`

## Reactive Controllers

- `AnimationController` — Start/stop RAF loops, auto-cleanup on `hostDisconnected`. Used by `<daw-playhead>`.
- `ViewportController` — Scroll-aware visible range with overscan buffer (1.5x). Attached to `.scroll-area` via `scrollSelector`. See Virtual Scrolling section.
- `EngineController` — (Scaffolded, not yet wired) DOM traversal to find closest `<daw-editor>`. Will be used by sub-elements that need engine access.
- `AudioResumeController` — One-shot AudioContext resume on first user gesture (`pointerdown`/`keydown`). Configurable target: host element (default), `'document'`, or CSS selector. Used by `<daw-editor eager-resume>`. Exported for standalone use.

**Lit controller lifecycle gotcha:** `hostConnected()` fires during `connectedCallback()`, BEFORE the first `willUpdate()`. Controllers that read properties set from attributes must defer work with `requestAnimationFrame` (as `ViewportController` and `AudioResumeController` do), otherwise the property will still be `undefined`.

## Pluggable Audio Backend

**`adapterFactory` JS property** — Optional function `() => PlayoutAdapter` on `<daw-editor>`. When set before tracks load, `_buildEngine` uses it instead of `createToneAdapter()`. Enables swapping Tone.js for `NativePlayoutAdapter` or custom backends without modifying dawcore source.

Example: `editor.adapterFactory = () => new NativePlayoutAdapter(audioCtx);`

## Ported Utilities

- `peak-rendering.ts` — `aggregatePeaks`, `calculateBarRects`, `calculateFirstBarPosition` (from `ui-components`)
- `smart-scale.ts` — `getScaleInfo`, `computeTemporalTicks` (extracted from `SmartScale.tsx`, temporal mode only)
- `time-format.ts` — `formatTime` for ruler labels

## Interaction Patterns

- **Seek during playback requires stop+play** — Tone.js `transport.seconds = time` doesn't reschedule audio sources. Must call `engine.stop()` then `engine.play(newTime)` and restart playhead animation.
- **Stop returns to play start position** — Standard DAW behavior. Engine tracks `_playStartPosition`; read `engine.getCurrentTime()` in the `stop` event handler, not `_currentTime`.
- **Pointer events, not click** — Use `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup` with 3px activation threshold to distinguish click (seek) from drag (selection). Wrap `releasePointerCapture` in try-catch; use `finally` to reset `_isDragging`.
- **No scrollLeft in pointer math** — `:host` has `overflow-x: auto`; `.timeline` is wider. `getBoundingClientRect().left` on `.timeline` already reflects scroll (goes negative when scrolled right), so `clientX - rect.left` gives the correct pixel. Do NOT add `scrollLeft`.
- **Track hit detection via Y position** — `composedPath()[0].closest('.track-row')` can't cross Shadow DOM boundaries. Use `getBoundingClientRect()` on track rows and compare `e.clientY` instead.
- **File type detection** — `file.type` can be empty string for valid audio (`.opus` on some browsers). Only reject files with explicitly non-audio MIME types: `if (file.type && !file.type.startsWith('audio/'))`.
- **`loadFiles()` returns result** — Returns `{ loaded: string[], failed: Array<{ file, error }> }` so callers can detect partial failures. Individual file errors are caught and reported via `daw-files-load-error` events.
- **sampleRate comes from decoded audio** — Always use `audioBuffer.sampleRate` for clip creation. The global AudioContext decodes at the hardware rate (may be 44100 or 48000). Set `this.sampleRate` from the first decoded buffer so the ruler, peaks, and engine all agree.
- **Use `getGlobalAudioContext()` for decode** — Import from `@waveform-playlist/playout`. Same context Tone.js uses. `decodeAudioData` works while suspended (pre-gesture). Never create a separate AudioContext for decoding.
- **Pointer interactions extracted** — `interactions/pointer-handler.ts` handles pointerdown/move/up, caches timeline ref and rect, distinguishes click vs drag. The host implements `PointerHandlerHost` interface.
- **Peak pipeline extracted** — `workers/peakPipeline.ts` manages worker lifecycle, WaveformData cache, inflight dedup.
- **Prevent native drag on interactive elements** — `<daw-editor>` has `@dragover`/`@drop` for file drops, which activates the browser's drag-and-drop system. Clip headers and boundaries need `e.preventDefault()` on `pointerdown` (in pointer-handler delegation), `-webkit-user-drag: none` and `user-select: none` in CSS to prevent the browser from stealing pointer events during custom drag operations.

## Clip Interactions

- **`ClipPointerHandler`** in `interactions/clip-pointer-handler.ts` — handles move/trim drag. `ClipEngineContract` is a narrow interface (`moveClip`, `trimClip`, `updateTrack`). `ClipPointerHost` interface satisfied by `<daw-editor>` via getters.
- **Hit detection uses `closest()`** — `composedPath()[0]` returns the deepest element (e.g., `<span>` inside `.clip-header`). Always use `target.closest('.clip-header')` / `target.closest('.clip-boundary')` to walk up.
- **Move: incremental deltas with `skipAdapter`** — `engine.moveClip(id, clipId, delta, true)` skips adapter during drag (60fps). Call `engine.updateTrack(trackId)` once on `pointerup` to sync Tone.js.
- **Trim: cumulative delta on drop only** — Engine's `constrainBoundaryTrim` checks constraints against current clip state, so incremental deltas compound incorrectly. Accumulate total delta during drag, call `engine.trimClip()` once on `pointerup`.
- **Trim visual feedback** — Imperatively update `.clip-container` CSS (`left`/`width`) during drag. Restore original CSS before engine applies.
- **`splitAtPlayhead()`** in `interactions/split-handler.ts` — discovers new clip IDs by diffing `engine.getState().tracks` before/after `engine.splitClip()` (returns void). Requires exactly 2 new IDs.
- **`_syncPeaksForChangedClips`** — Called in statechange handler when `tracksVersion` changes. Regenerates peaks for clips with new IDs (split) or changed `offsetSamples`/`durationSamples` (trim). Without this, split clips have no waveform and trimmed clips show wrong audio portion.
- **`cleanupOrphanedClipData`** — Called by `syncPeaksForChangedClips` to remove entries from `_clipBuffers`, `_clipOffsets`, `_peaksData` for clip IDs no longer in any track. Prevents memory leaks after split (original clip ID becomes orphaned).
- **Trim peak re-extraction** — During trim drag, call `host.reextractClipPeaks()` to synchronously re-slice peaks from cached WaveformData at the new offset/duration. When peaks are available, set waveforms to `left:0` (peaks cover full new bounds). Fall back to `-deltaPx` shift only when cache unavailable.
- **Statechange syncs `_engineTracks`** — When `tracksVersion` changes, rebuild `_engineTracks` Map from engine state. This is how `moveClip`/`trimClip`/`splitClip` trigger Lit re-renders.
- **`DRAG_THRESHOLD`** — Shared constant in `interactions/constants.ts` (3px, click vs drag). Boundary width (8px) is CSS-only in `styles/theme.ts` (CSS can't import JS constants).
- **`<daw-keyboard-shortcuts>` element** — Render-less child of `<daw-editor>`. Uses `closest('daw-editor')` for parent resolution (light DOM, not shadow). Boolean attributes for presets (`playback`, `splitting`, `undo`). JS properties for remapping (`playbackShortcuts`, `splittingShortcuts`, `undoShortcuts`) and custom shortcuts (`customShortcuts`). Listener on `document`. Uses `handleKeyboardEvent` from `@waveform-playlist/core`.
- **Split pre-flight check** — `splitAtPlayhead` calls `canSplitAtTime` before stopping playback. Without this, pressing S with no track selected interrupts audio for a no-op.
- **`engine.constrainTrimDelta()`** — Wraps the engine's `constrainBoundaryTrim` pure function. Call during trim drag for per-frame collision detection (timeline bounds, audio bounds, neighbor overlap, min duration). Don't manually clamp — use the engine's constraints so visual preview matches what's applied on drop.
- **Drag transactions for undo** — `beginTransaction()` at drag start (`_beginDrag`), `commitTransaction()` in `finally` of `onPointerUp`. Groups all per-frame `moveClip`/`trimClip` calls into one undo step. Without this, a 1-second drag creates 60 individual undo steps.
- **Undo/redo keyboard shortcuts** — Cmd/Ctrl+Z (undo), Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z (redo) when `<daw-keyboard-shortcuts undo>` is present. Auto-expands to both Ctrl and Meta variants when no specific modifier is provided. Uses `=== undefined` checks (not falsy) to distinguish "not specified" from "explicitly false".
- **Peaks-First Rendering** — When `peaks-src` is set, `_loadTrack` awaits the `.dat` file first (small, fast), creates a clip via `createClipFromSeconds({ waveformData, ... })` (no `audioBuffer`), extracts peaks, and renders a preview track immediately. Audio decode runs in the background; on completion, `clip.audioBuffer` is backfilled and the clip is added to `_clipBuffers`. WaveformData is cached in `PeakPipeline` via `cacheWaveformData(audioBuffer, waveformData)` so all downstream paths (zoom, split/trim) skip the worker. If `.dat` loading fails, falls through to the standard audio-first path. If audio decode fails after peaks render, preview state is cleaned up (peaks, engineTracks, clipOffsets, zoom floor) before dispatching `daw-track-error`. `_peaksCache` (`Map<string, Promise<WaveformData>>`) deduplicates in-flight and repeated fetches for the same `.dat`/`.json` URL, mirroring `_audioCache`. Cleared in `disconnectedCallback`; deleted on rejection to allow retry.
- **`samplesPerPixel` Zoom Floor via `noAccessor`** — `samplesPerPixel` uses `@property({ noAccessor: true })` with a custom getter/setter that clamps to `_minSamplesPerPixel` synchronously and rejects NaN/Infinity/zero/negative. `_minSamplesPerPixel` lifecycle: set only after successful `extractPeaks` in `_loadTrack` (not before — avoids restricting zoom on failure), recomputed via `_peakPipeline.getMaxCachedScale()` on track removal, reset to 0 on `disconnectedCallback`.
- **`configureGlobalContext` Race with Eager Resume** — `AudioResumeController` (or any gesture handler) can call `getGlobalContext()` before `_ensureContextConfigured` runs, creating the context without the sample rate hint. `configureGlobalContext` handles this gracefully: warns and returns the existing rate instead of throwing. For reliable sample rate control, avoid `eager-resume` or ensure `configureGlobalContext` runs before any user gesture.
- **`sample-rate` Attribute for Peaks Matching** — `<daw-editor sample-rate="48000">` passes the rate to `configureGlobalContext({ sampleRate })` in `_ensureContextConfigured`. Cannot force the rate (Tone.js limitation) but warns on mismatch and triggers worker fallback for pre-computed peaks.

## Typed Events

- **`DawEventMap`** in `src/events.ts` — all 12 custom events with typed details. Use `new CustomEvent<DetailType>(...)` at dispatch sites.
- **`LoadFilesResult`** — named return type for `loadFiles()`, exported from index.
- **`PointerEngineContract`** in `interactions/pointer-handler.ts` — narrow engine interface (5 methods). `PointerHandlerHost._engine` uses this, not `PlaylistEngine` directly.
- Always dispatch `daw-track-select` event on both engine and no-engine paths.

## Sample Rate

- `sampleRate` `@property` is an initial hint (default 48000). `_resolvedSampleRate` is set from decoded audio.
- **Always use `effectiveSampleRate`** in internal calculations — returns `_resolvedSampleRate ?? sampleRate`.
- `PointerHandlerHost` uses `effectiveSampleRate`, not `sampleRate`.

## File Drop

- **Always revoke blob URLs** — `URL.revokeObjectURL(blobUrl)` after decode succeeds or in the catch block.
- `_getOrderedTracks()` sorts DOM-declared tracks by position, file-dropped tracks (not in DOM) sort after, preserving Map insertion order among themselves.

## Web Worker Peak Generation

- **`peaksWorker.ts`** — Inline Blob worker (portable across bundlers). Generates WaveformData binary format from AudioBuffer channel data at a given scale. Uses `generateWaveformData` algorithm from BBC's waveform-data.js (MIT). Includes fix for upstream trailing-bin offset bug in 16-bit multi-channel.
- **`waveformDataUtils.ts`** — `extractPeaks()` converts WaveformData → PeakData. Handles all channels, mono merging (weighted average), slicing, and aligned resampling.
- **`peakPipeline.ts`** — Orchestrates worker lifecycle, WaveformData cache (WeakMap per AudioBuffer), inflight dedup, and peak extraction at any zoom level.
- **Peak resolution order:** (1) WaveformData cache hit → `extractPeaks()` (synchronous resample), (2) worker generation → cache → extract.
- **Zoom re-extraction:** `willUpdate()` detects `samplesPerPixel` changes and re-extracts peaks from cached WaveformData. Only works for scales coarser than the cached base — finer zoom requires regeneration via worker.
- **Aligned resampling** — When slicing WaveformData before resampling to a different scale, source slice indices must align to the resampling ratio. Uses `floor(targetStart * ratio)` / `ceil(targetEnd * ratio)` to include all contributing source bins. See browser CLAUDE.md "Aligned Peak Resampling" for full explanation.
- **CSP fallback** — Worker creation can fail in CSP-restricted environments blocking blob: URLs. The fallback rejects with actionable error message suggesting `worker-src blob:` directive.
- **Disconnect guard** — `_loadTrack` catch checks `this.isConnected` before dispatching error events (detached elements can't bubble, CLAUDE.md pattern #36).

## Virtual Scrolling

- **`ViewportController`** — Lit reactive controller. Attaches to `.scroll-area` (via `scrollSelector`) in `hostConnected` — auto-reattaches on disconnect/reconnect. Tracks scroll position with 1.5x overscan buffer and 100px threshold. Calls `requestUpdate()` on attach and scroll.
- **`getVisibleChunkIndices()`** — Shared pure function in `utils/viewport.ts`, re-exported from `viewport-controller.ts`. Used by `daw-waveform._getVisibleChunkIndices()`.
- **Permissive defaults** — Controller initializes `visibleStart=-Infinity, visibleEnd=Infinity` so all chunks render before scroll container is attached.
- **`daw-waveform` props** — `visibleStart`, `visibleEnd`, `originX` control which 1000px canvas chunks are rendered. Defaults to all-visible when not set.
- **File size budget** — `daw-editor.ts` hard max 800 lines. `loadFiles` extracted to `interactions/file-loader.ts`; `addRecordedClip` extracted to `interactions/recording-clip.ts`; `TrackDescriptor`/`ClipDescriptor` extracted to `src/types.ts`.

## Track Controls

- **`<daw-track-controls>`** — Shadow DOM element. Receives track state as props from editor, dispatches `daw-track-control` and `daw-track-remove` events.
- **Controls outside scroll container** — Flex layout: fixed `.controls-column` (180px, `--daw-controls-width`) + `.scroll-area` (overflow-x: auto). Controls stay fixed while waveforms scroll.
- **Direct engine forwarding** — `daw-track-control` handler updates `_tracks` descriptor AND forwards to engine directly. Does not go through `<daw-track>` DOM element roundtrip (file-dropped tracks have no DOM element).
- **Track ID alignment** — `createTrack()` generates its own `id`. Must set `track.id = trackId` after creation so `engine.setTrackSolo/Mute/Volume/Pan(trackId, ...)` can find the track. Applied in both `_loadTrack` and `file-loader.ts`.

## File Loader Extraction

- **`interactions/file-loader.ts`** — `loadFiles()` extracted via `FileLoaderHost` interface to keep editor under 800 lines.
- **`src/types.ts`** — `TrackDescriptor` and `ClipDescriptor` interfaces, shared by `daw-editor.ts` and `file-loader.ts`. Re-exported from `index.ts`.
- **Non-private fields** — Fields accessed by the loader (`_tracks`, `_engineTracks`, `_peaksData`, `_clipBuffers`, `_clipOffsets`, `_audioCache`, `_peakPipeline`, `_resolvedSampleRate`, `_fetchAndDecode`, `_recomputeDuration`, `_ensureEngine`) are non-private (no `private` keyword, `_` prefix convention only).
- **Per-clip Map cleanup** — Any `Map` keyed by clip ID (`_clipBuffers`, `_clipOffsets`, `_peaksData`) must be cleaned in `_onTrackRemoved`. When adding a new per-clip Map, add the corresponding `.delete(clip.id)` in the removal loop.

## Empty State

- Hide playhead, selection, and ruler when `orderedTracks.length === 0`
- Timeline width: `100%` when empty (not hardcoded pixels) for full-width dropzone
- `.scroll-area` has `min-height: var(--daw-min-height, 200px)` for visible empty dropzone

## Lit/TypeScript Requirements

- `experimentalDecorators: true` and `useDefineForClassFields: false` in tsconfig — required for Lit's `@property` and `@customElement` decorators
- Light DOM elements override `createRenderRoot()` to return `this`
- `<daw-track>` defers `daw-track-connected` dispatch via `setTimeout(, 0)` so the editor's `connectedCallback` (which registers listeners) has time to run
